# Pong_Game
Everyone knows of the traditional Pong game playered by two people.
Starting with one player having the ball in his court and trying to send it out of the other player's court.
I used Java and processing to programm the game and to be able to run it on your computer
you have to use the core library of processing.
I must admit alot of things could be done in a much better way :)
i made each class seperatable runnable. That way you can run the class of each object and maybe
better understand how the code works.
To run the entire game use the ProcessingObj class
